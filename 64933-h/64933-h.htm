<p><span class="xxlarge">E</span><i>noch Arnold Bennett was born at
Hanley-in-the-Potteries (one of the &#8220;Five Towns&#8221;
frequently appearing in his writings) on 27th
May 1867. He was educated at the endowed Middle
School, Newcastle-under-Lyme, and matriculated
in the London University. From school he went
into the office of his father, who practised as a
solicitor at Hanley, and stayed with him until
1889, when he took a post in a solicitor&#8217;s office
in London, which he held until 1893. In that
year he abandoned the law finally to become assistant
editor of</i> Woman, <i>and succeeded to the editorship in
1896. This post he resigned in 1900 to devote himself
exclusively to literature. In the meantime several
of his works had been issued, the first being &#8220;A Man
from the North&#8221; (1898) and a handbook, &#8220;Journalism
for Women,&#8221; followed in the next year by the
publication of a volume of plays, &#8220;Polite Farces,&#8221; his
first experiments in drama. Afterwards appeared in
rapid succession nine other novels, two volumes of
short stories, seven volumes of belles-lettres, and seven
fantasias. Besides these he wrote two plays, &#8220;Cupid
and Common-Sense,&#8221; produced by the Stage Society
in 1908, and &#8220;What the Public Wants,&#8221; also produced
by the Stage Society in 1909, and afterwards
by Mr. Hawtrey at the New Royalty Theatre. Both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
these plays were subsequently staged in Glasgow, and
by Miss Horniman&#8217;s Company. The most important
of his publications include:&mdash;among novels, &#8220;Leonora,&#8221;
&#8220;A Great Man,&#8221; &#8220;Sacred and Profane Love,&#8221; &#8220;Whom
God Hath Joined&mdash;&mdash;,&#8221; &#8220;The Old Wives&#8217; Tale,&#8221; and
&#8220;Clayhanger&#8221;; among the belles-lettres, &#8220;The Truth
about an Author,&#8221; &#8220;Literary Taste,&#8221; &#8220;The Reasonable
Life,&#8221; &#8220;The Human Machine,&#8221; and &#8220;How to
Live on Twenty-Four Hours a Day&#8221; (the last four
contributed originally to</i> T. P.&#8217;s Weekly, <i>and containing
indications of Mr. Bennett&#8217;s theories of life); and
in the short stories, &#8220;Tales of the Five Towns,&#8221; and
&#8220;The Grim Smile of the Five Towns.&#8221; Mr. Bennett
has very definite leanings towards Socialism, and,
under a pseudonym, writes regularly for</i> The New
Age. <i>He also contributes from time to time to the
most important progressive weekly and monthly
magazines.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>January</i></h2>
</div>

<div class="hangingindent">

<h3><i>One</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The individual who scoffs at New Year&#8217;s
resolutions resembles the woman who
says she doesn&#8217;t look under the bed at
nights; the truth is not in him.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Two</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To give pleasure is the highest end of
any work of art, because the pleasure
procured from any art is tonic, and
transforms the life into which it enters.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Three</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are only two fundamental differences
in the world&mdash;the difference between
sex and sex, and the difference
between youth and age.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Four</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The only class of modern play in which
it is possible to be both quite artistic
and quite marketable, is the farce.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></p>


<h3><i>Five</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To enjoy a work of imagination is no
pastime, rather a sweet but fatiguing
labour. After a play of Shakespeare or
a Wagnerian opera repose is needed.
Only a madman like Louis of Bavaria
could demand <i>Tristan</i> twice in one
night.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Six</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Great books do not spring from something
accidental in the great men who
wrote them. They are the effluence of
their very core, the expression of the life
itself of the authors.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Seven</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is within the experience of everyone
that when pleasure and pain reach a
certain intensity they are indistinguishable.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Eight</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One of the main obstacles to the cultivation
of poetry in the average sensible
man is an absurdly inflated notion of
the ridiculous.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>


<h3><i>Nine</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The crudest excitement of the imaginative
faculty is to be preferred to a swinish
preoccupation with the gross physical
existence.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Ten</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The brain is the diplomatist which arranges
relations between our instinctive
self and the universe, and it fulfils its
mission when it provides for the maximum
of freedom to the instincts with
the minimum of friction.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Eleven</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A woman who has beauty wants to
frame it in beauty. The eye is a sensualist,
and its appetites, once aroused,
grow. A beautiful woman takes the
same pleasure in the sight of another
beautiful woman as a man does; only
jealousy or fear prevents her from admitting
the pleasure.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Twelve</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The beginning of wise living lies in the
control of the brain by the will.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span></p>


<h3><i>Thirteen</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To utter a jeremiad upon the decadence
of taste, to declare that literature is
going to the dogs because a fourth-rate
novel has been called a masterpiece and
has made someone&#8217;s fortune, would be
absurd. I have a strong faith that taste
is as good as ever it was, and that literature
will continue on its way undisturbed.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Fourteen</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is a loveliness of so imperious, absolute,
dazzling a kind that it banishes
from the hearts of men all moral conceptions,
all considerations of right and
wrong, and leaves therein nothing but
worship and desire.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Fifteen</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When homage is reiterated, when the
pleasure of obeying a command and
satisfying a caprice is begged for, when
roses are strewn, and even necks put
down in the path, one forgets to be
humble; one forgets that in meekness
alone lies the sole good; one confuses
deserts with the hazards of heredity.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>


<h3><i>Sixteen</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are men who are capable of loving
a machine more deeply than they can
love a woman. They are among the
happiest men on earth.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Seventeen</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The uncultivated reader is content to
live wholly in and for the moment,
sentence by sentence. Keep him amused
and he will ask no more. You may delude him,
you may withhold from him
every single thing to which he is rightfully
entitled, but he will not care. The
more crude you are, the better will he
be pleased.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Eighteen</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is only in the stress of fine ideas and
emotions that a man may be truly said
to live.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Nineteen</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Oh, innocence! Oh, divine ignorance! Oh,
refusal! None knows your value save
her who has bartered you! And herein
is the woman&#8217;s tragedy.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span></p>


<h3><i>Twenty</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To extract from the brain, at will and
by will, concentration on a given idea
for even so short a period as half an hour
is an exceedingly difficult feat&mdash;and
a fatiguing! It needs perseverance.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Twenty-one</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A merely literary crudity will affect the
large public neither one way nor the
other, since the large public is entirely
uninterested in questions of style; but
all other crudities appeal strongly to
that public.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Twenty-two</i></h3>

<h4><i>&#8220;Cupid and Commonsense&#8221; produced.</i></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Everyone who has driven a motor-car knows
the uncanny sensation that ensues
when for the first time in your life
you engage the clutch, and the Thing
beneath you begins mysteriously and
formidably to move. It is at once an
astonishment, a terror, and a delight.
I felt like that as I watched the progress
of my first play.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span></p>


<h3><i>Twenty-three</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Can you see the sun over the viaduct at
Loughborough Junction of a morning,
and catch its rays in the Thames off
Dewar&#8217;s whisky monument, and not
shake with the joy of life? If so, you
and Shakespeare are not yet in communication.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Twenty-four</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Adults have never yet invented any institution,
festival or diversion specially
for the benefit of children. The
egoism of adults makes such an effort
impossible, and the ingenuity and pliancy
of children make it unnecessary.
The pantomime, for example, which is
now pre-eminently a diversion for children,
was created by adults for the
amusement of adults. Children have
merely accepted it and appropriated it.
Children, being helpless, are of course
fatalists and imitators. They take what
comes, and they do the best they can
with it. And when they have made
something their own that was adult,
they stick to it like leeches.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span></p>


<h3><i>Twenty-five</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The living speak of the uncanniness of the
dead. It does not occur to them that
manifestations of human existence may
be uncanny to the dead.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Twenty-six</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is no royal road to the control of
the brain. There is no patent dodge
about it, and no complicated function
which a plain person may not comprehend.
It is simply a question of: &#8220;I
will, <i>I</i> will, and I <i>will</i>.&#8221;</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Twenty-seven</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I knew that when love lasted, the credit
of the survival was due far more often
to the woman than to the man. The
woman must husband herself, dole herself
out, economise herself so that she might
be splendidly wasteful when need was.
The woman must plan, scheme, devise,
invent, reconnoitre, take precautions;
and do all this sincerely and lovingly in
the name and honour of love. A passion
for her is a campaign; and her deadliest
enemy is satiety.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span></p>


<h3><i>Twenty-eight</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Efficient living, living up to one&#8217;s best
standard, getting the last ounce of power
out of the machine with the minimum
of friction: these things depend on the
disciplined and vigorous condition of the
brain.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Twenty-nine</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the world of books, as in every other
world, one-half does not know how the
other half lives. In literary matters the
literate seldom suspect the extreme simplicity
and <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of the illiterate. They
wilfully blind themselves to it; they are
afraid to face it.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Thirty</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The mysteriousness of woman vanishes
the instant you brutally face it. Boys
and ageing celibates are obsessed by the
mysteriousness of woman. The obsession
is a sign either of immaturity or
of morbidity. The mysteriousness of
woman,&mdash;take her, and see then if she
is mysterious!</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span></p>


<h3><i>Thirty-one</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Train journeys have too often been sorrowful
for me, so much so that the conception
itself of a train, crawling over
the country like a snake, or flying across
it like a winged monster, fills me with
melancholy. Trains loaded with human
parcels of sadness and illusion and brief
joy, wandering about, crossing, and
occasionally colliding in the murk of
existence; trains warmed and lighted in
winter; trains open to catch the air of
your own passage in summer; night-trains
that pierce the night with your
yellow, glaring eyes, and waken mysterious
villages, and leave the night behind
and run into the dawn as into a station;
trains that carry bread and meats for
the human parcels, and pillows and
fountains of fresh water; trains that
sweep haughtily and wearily indifferent
through the landscapes and the towns,
sufficient unto yourselves, hasty, panting,
formidable, and yet mournful entities:
I have understood you in your
arrogance and your pathos!</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<h3><i>One</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The ecstasy of longing is better than
the assuaging of desire.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Two</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As regards facts and ideas, the great
mistake made by the average well-intentioned
reader is that he is content with
the names of things instead of occupying
himself with the causes of things.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Three</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Time and increasing knowledge of the
true facts have dissipated for me the
melancholy and affecting legend of literary
talent going a-begging because of
the indifference of publishers. O young
author of talent, would that I could find
you and make you understand how the
publisher yearns for you as the lover for
his love.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span></p>


<h3><i>Four</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The brain can be disciplined by learning
the habit of obedience. And it can learn
the habit of obedience by the practice
of concentration.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Five</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You can attach any ideas you please to
music, but music, if you will forgive me
saying so, rejects them all equally. Art
has to do with emotions not with ideas,
and the great defect of literature is that
it can only express emotions by means
of ideas. What makes music the greatest
of all the arts is that it can express
emotions without ideas. Literature can
appeal to the soul only through the mind.
Music goes direct. Its language is a
language which the soul alone understands,
but which the soul can never
translate.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Six</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If a man does not spend at least as much
time in actively and definitely thinking
about what he has read as he spent in
reading, he is simply insulting his author.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span></p>


<h3><i>Seven</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He was of that small and lonely minority
of men who never know ambition, ardour,
zeal, yearning, tears; whose convenient
desires are capable of immediate satisfaction;
of whom it may be said that
they purchase a second-rate happiness
cheap at the price of an incapacity for
deep feeling.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Eight</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No man, except a greater author, can teach
an author his business.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Nine</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Size is the quality which most strongly
and surely appeals to the imagination of
the multitude. Of all modern monuments
the Eiffel Tower and the Big
Wheel have aroused the most genuine
curiosity and admiration: they are the
biggest. As with this monstrous architecture
of metals, so with the fabric of
ideas and emotions: the attention of the
whole crowd can only be caught by an
audacious hugeness, an eye-smiting enormity
of dimensions so gross as to be
nearly physical.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span></p>


<h3><i>Ten</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Genius apart, woman is usually more touchingly
lyrical than man in the yearning
for the ideal.</p>
</div>

<p>Literature is the art of using words. This
is not a platitude, but a truth of the
first importance, a truth so profound
that many writers never get down to it,
and so subtle that many other writers
who think they see it never in fact
really comprehend it. The business of
the author is with words. The practisers
of other arts, such as music and painting,
deal with ideas and emotions, but
only the author has to deal with them by
means of words. Words are his exclusive
possession among creative artists and
craftsmen. They are his raw material,
his tools and instruments, his manufactured
product, his alpha and omega.
He may abound in ideas and emotions
of the finest kind, but those ideas and
emotions cannot be said to have an
effective existence until they are expressed;
they are limited to the extent
of their expression; and their expression
is limited to the extent of the author&#8217;s
skill in the use of words. I smile when
I hear people say, &#8220;If I could <i>write</i>, if
I could only put down what I feel&mdash;!&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Such people beg the whole question. The
ability to <i>write</i> is the sole thing peculiar
to literature&mdash;not the ability to think
nor the ability to feel, but the ability
to write, to utilise words.</p>

<p>The art of fiction is the art of telling a
story. This statement is not so obvious
and unnecessary as it may seem. Most
beginners and many &#8220;practised hands&#8221;
attend to all kinds of things before they
attend to the story. With them the
art of fiction is the art of describing
character or landscape, of getting &#8220;atmosphere,&#8221;
and of being humorous, pathetic,
flippant, or terrifying; while the
story is a perfunctory excuse for these
feats. They are so busy with the traditional
paraphernalia of fiction, with the
tricks of the craft, that what should
be the principal business is reduced to
a subsidiary task. They forget that
character, landscape, atmosphere, humour,
pathos, etc., are not ends in
themselves, but only means toward an

an imperious fascination. Long before

curiously into the carriages he wonders
that men and women, who in a few

Piccadilly and the Strand, can contemplate
the immediate future with so
much apparent calmness; some of them
even have the audacity to look bored.
He finds it difficult to keep from throwing

is a speck upon the distance does he turn
away and, nodding absently to the
ticket-clerk, who knows him well, go

a special one to a newspaper with the
largest circulation. He ought to have
returned to England, grown a mane
and a tufted tail, and become the king
of beasts; or at least to have made a

that if twenty of the most honoured

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I do not forget that the realism of one
age is the conventionality of the next.
In the main the tendency of art is always
to reduce and simplify its conventions,
thus necessitating an increase
of virtuosity in order to obtain the same
effects of shapeliness and rhythm.</p>

<p>For the majority of people the earth is
a dull planet. It is only a Stevenson
who can say: &#8220;I never remember being

whether even Stevenson uttered truth

None of us escapes boredom entirely;
some of us, indeed, are bored
during the greater part of our lives. The

<h3><i>Twenty-eight</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is natural that people who concern
themselves with art only in their leisure
moments, demanding from it nothing
but a temporary distraction, should prefer
the obvious to the recondite, and
should walk regardless of beauty unless
it forces itself upon their attention by

<p>When a book attains a large circulation
one usually says that it succeeds. But
the fine books succeed of themselves, by

them in cabinets, cast them into Sahara;
still they imperturbably succeed. If, on
a rare occasion, such a book sells by
scores of thousands, it is not the book

the book but the public which has
emerged splendidly from a trial.</p>

the artist&#8217;s prerogative as an explorer

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is well to remind ourselves that literature
is first and last a means of
life, and that the enterprise of forming
one&#8217;s literary taste is an enterprise of
learning how best to use this means of
life.</p>

<p>Instead of saying, &#8220;Sorry I can&#8217;t see

I have to work.&#8221; This, I admit, is

</div>


<h3><i>Five</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Characterisation, the feat of individualising
characters, is the inmost mystery of
imaginative literary art. It is of the
very essence of the novel. It never belongs
to this passage or that. It is
implicit in the whole. It is always
being done, and is never finished till the
last page is written.</p>

<h4><i>Ivan Serge&iuml;tch Turgenev&#8217;s Birthday</i></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The author of a miracle like <i>On the Eve</i>
may be born, but he is also made. In
the matter of condensation alone Turgenev
was unique among the great
literary artificers. He could say more
in a chapter of two thousand words than
any other novelist that ever lived. What
he accomplishes again and again in a
book of sixty thousand words, Tolstoi
could not have accomplished under a
quarter of a million.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have never once produced any literary
work without a preliminary incentive
quite other than the incentive of ebullient
imagination. I have never &#8220;wanted
to write,&#8221; until the extrinsic advantages
of writing had presented themselves to
me.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Twelve</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beauty is strangely various. There is the
beauty of light and joy and strength
exulting; but there is also the beauty
of shade, of sorrow and sadness, and of
humility oppressed. The spirit of the
sublime dwells not only in the high and
remote; it shines unperceived amid all
the usual meannesses of our daily
existence.</p>

<p>Although a very greedy eater of literature,
I can only enjoy reading when I

become almost incapable of the act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span></p>


<h3><i>Eighteen</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I would point out that literature by no
means comprises the whole field of
knowledge, and that the disturbing thirst
to improve one&#8217;s self&mdash;to increase one&#8217;s
knowledge&mdash;may well be slaked quite
apart from literature.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Nineteen</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The public, by its casual approval, may
give notoriety and a vogue which passes,
but it is incapable of the sustained ardour
of appreciation which alone results
in authentic renown. It is incapable
because it is nonchalant. To the public
art is a very little thing&mdash;a distraction,
the last resort against <i>ennui</i>. To the
critics art looms enormous. They do
not merely possess views; they are
possessed by them. Their views amount
to a creed, and that creed must be spread.
Quiescence is torment to the devotee.
He cannot cry peace when there is no
peace. Passionate conviction, like murder,
will out. &#8220;I believe; therefore you
must believe&#8221;: that is the motto which
moves the world.</p>

<p>Publishers as a commercial class are neither
more nor less honourable than any
other commercial class, and authors
are neither more nor less honourable
than publishers. In the world of commerce
one fights for one&#8217;s own hand and
keeps within the law; the code is universally
understood, and the man who

<h3><i>Twenty-two</i></h3>

<p>There can be no sort of doubt that unless
I was prepared to flout the wisdom of

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The most important preliminary to the
task of arranging one&#8217;s life so that one

<h3><i>Twenty-seven</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The critic&#8217;s first requisite is that he
should be interested. A man may have
an instinctive good taste, but if his
attitude is one of apathy, then he is not
a true critic. The opinions of the public
are often wrong; the opinions of the
critic are usually right. But the fundamental
difference between these two
bodies does not lie here; it lies in the
fact that the critics &#8220;care,&#8221; while the
public does not care.</p>

<h3><i>Twenty-eight</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When, after the theatre, a woman precedes
a man into a carriage, does she
not publish and glory in the fact that she

enforced bend of one&#8217;s head as one steps
in. And when the man shuts the door
with a masculine snap&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Ardour in well-doing is a misleading and
a treacherous thing. It cries out loudly
for employment; you can&#8217;t satisfy it at
first; it wants more and more; it is
eager to move mountains and divert the
course of rivers; it isn&#8217;t content till it
perspires. And then, too often, when
it feels the perspiration on its brow, it
wearies all of a sudden and dies, without
even putting itself to the trouble of
saying, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough of this.&#8221;</p>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
